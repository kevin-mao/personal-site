# Some Background
I was born to Chinese immigrant parents in Miami, raised in Brooklyn, and received my Bachelors of Science at Columbia University in 2021. Now I work in Seattle, where I enjoy hiking, the local food and music, and taking photos!

I was always fascinated by the intracacies of science and technology and inspired by their potential impact. I was actually originally a Biomedical Engineering major, but that changed once I discovered Computer Science. Since my first programming class freshman year of college, I&apos;ve always loved the process of immersing myself under the hood of a complex software system until I finally grasped it. The feelings of curiosity followed by excitement when I finally compiled and deployed a solution others could actually use are unmatched. As you can tell, I am passionate about learning and growing my engineering skills and I strive to do so in order to develop more powerful and impactful software solutions.

# Some Facts
- At 13, I achieved the highest grade at ARBSM (a music examination board) for piano and saxophone. I was consistently in band/orchestra throughout all of my schooling and I play piano to this day.
- At 16, I became second author to a chemistry resarch publication (<a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/cp/c6cp01443g#!divAbstract" target="_blank">Link</a>). I was itching to jump into the world of science so I cold-emailed professors at local colleges, asking if they needed any more assistants. Dr. Ming Tang accepted my offer and after a summer of research, the paper was the result.
- At 19, I spent a summer abroad in Paris, studying art history and music history. I had always loved music but this is when I discovered the world of fine art.
- In college, I was a part of the Columbia Bartending Agency, Biomedical Engineering Society, Pops Orchestra, and more.
- I have a FujiFilm x100v and a Canon EOS Rebel SL2. I'm still working on a photography section for this website, so for now you can check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmao.jpg/" target="_blank">instagram</a>!
